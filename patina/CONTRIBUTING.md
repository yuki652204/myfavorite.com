# Contributing to Patina

Thanks for considering a contribution. Patina is a pattern-based tool, so the most impactful contributions are usually new patterns, better examples, or profile refinements.

## Public vs. Internal Docs

User-facing documentation lives in `README*.md`, `docs/`, `examples/`, `patterns/`, `profiles/`, and the skill entrypoints. Maintainer or agent notes live under `docs/internal/` and should not be treated as install, CLI, or API contracts unless they are promoted back into the public docs list.

When moving a root-level Markdown file, either link it from `README.md` if it is public, or place it under `docs/internal/` with a short status note explaining its audience.

## Korean Translation Policy

Primary user docs should keep a Korean companion when they explain installation, support, contribution, examples, or troubleshooting. The required pairs are:

- `README.md` → `README_KR.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` → `CONTRIBUTING_KR.md`
- `docs/FAQ.md` → `docs/FAQ_KR.md`
- `docs/AUTHENTICATION.md` → `docs/AUTHENTICATION_KR.md`
- `docs/EXAMPLES.md` → `docs/EXAMPLES_KR.md`

When a PR changes one of these English files, update the Korean pair in the same PR or explain why the translation can safely lag. Keep commands, paths, config keys, issue numbers, and code fences unchanged unless the source file itself changes them.

## Adding a New Pattern

1. **Pick the right pack.** Patterns live in `patterns/{lang}-{category}.md`. Categories: content, language, style, structure, communication, filler.

2. **Follow the template.** Each pattern needs:
   - Number (next available, e.g. #30)
   - Watch words
   - Fire condition (when should it trigger?)
   - Exclusion condition (when should it NOT trigger?)
   - Problem description
   - Before/after example

3. **Add to all languages you can.** We have 4 language packs (ko, en, zh, ja). If you only know one, that's fine — file the PR for that language and note the others need translation.

4. **Update counts.** After adding a pattern:
   - Pack header: increment `patterns:` count
   - README.md and README_KR.md: update pattern tables and totals
   - SKILL.md description: update total if hardcoded

5. **Add an example.** If possible, add `examples/{lang}-{number}-success-01.md` and `examples/{lang}-{number}-failure-01.md` (false positive case).

## Improving an Existing Pattern

The most common improvement: better before/after examples. The "after" text should preserve the original meaning — not rewrite it into something different.

Good test: if someone read only the "after" text, would they get the same takeaway as the "before"? If the sentiment flips, the example is bad.

## Pattern Evaluation Checklist

Before opening a pattern PR, check:

- **Fire condition:** would at least 2-3 real AI-generated examples trigger it?
- **Exclusion condition:** can a human-written, domain-appropriate example avoid the hit?
- **Semantic risk:** what facts, numbers, polarity, causation, or domain terms could be damaged by the rewrite?
- **Before/after pair:** does the after version preserve the same claims without merely swapping synonyms?
- **Freshness evidence:** link a 50-document hot/cold fixture, manifest, or collection plan when proposing an emerging model-era tell.
- **Count sync:** pack frontmatter `patterns:` must match numbered `### N.` pattern headings.

## False Positive Triage Workflow

False positives are expected, especially for academic, encyclopedic, legal, corporate, or heavily edited prose. To report one:

1. Use the false-positive issue template.
2. Include language, genre/register, score/audit excerpt, and the specific pattern that over-fired.
3. Remove private text or replace it with a minimal redistributable excerpt.
4. Suggest whether the fix should be an exclusion rule, lower severity, profile override, or benchmark fixture.

Maintainers should prefer tightening exclusions over deleting patterns outright.

## Adding Benchmark Fixtures

Suspect-zone fixtures live under `tests/fixtures/suspect-zones/{lang}/{ai|natural}/`.

Each fixture needs YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
fixture_id: en-ai-07-example
language: en
class: ai
expected_hot: true
why_designed_this_way: |
  Explain which deterministic signal should fire and why.
expected_metrics:
  cv_band: low
---
```

Then run:

```bash
npm run benchmark:report
```

This regenerates `tests/quality/results.json`, `docs/benchmarks/latest.json`, and `docs/benchmarks/latest.md`.

## Translating Examples

- Preserve the original semantic anchors: numbers, entities, negation, causation, and modality.
- Do not translate an English AI tell literally if it is not a tell in the target language.
- Add a target-language false-positive note when a phrase is normal in that register.
- Keep examples redistributable; do not paste private user text.

## Adding a Profile

Profiles live in `profiles/{name}.md`. Copy an existing one (e.g. `blog.md`) and adjust:
- `voice-overrides`: which voice dimensions to amplify/suppress
- `pattern-overrides`: per-language pattern severity adjustments

## Pattern Staleness

AI writing patterns evolve as models get fine-tuned. Some patterns decay (e.g. "delve" after it became a meme), while new ones emerge. 

How we handle this:
- **Community reporting:** If you notice a pattern that's no longer a reliable signal, open an issue
- **New pattern proposals:** If you spot a new AI tell, file an issue with 3+ real-world examples and a 50-document evaluation fixture or collection plan
- **Quarterly review:** Maintainers follow [`process/pattern-freshness.md`](process/pattern-freshness.md) for corpus freeze windows, promotion thresholds, and frontmatter metadata
- **Lexicon provenance:** Newly mined or re-mined lexicon entries need `added`, `source`, and `last_validated` provenance before changing shipped behavior; run `npm run lexicon:freshness` to verify sidecars match the shipped entries
- **Version notes:** Each pattern pack has a `version` field — bump it when patterns change
- **No deletion without replacement:** We don't remove patterns outright; we mark them as `low` severity or move them to `reduce` in profiles

## Versioning Policy

Patina uses semantic versioning for both CLI behavior and pattern-pack compatibility.

- **Major:** remove or renumber patterns, break config/result schemas, change public CLI semantics, or make existing pattern packs incompatible.
- **Minor:** add a pattern, language, profile, mode, backend, benchmark schema field, or contributor-facing workflow.
- **Patch:** fix bugs, adjust severity/exclusions, clarify examples, update docs, refresh benchmark fixtures without changing schemas.

Every changelog entry should include a short semver rationale line so downstream users know whether to pin, test, or upgrade normally.

## Code of Conduct

Be helpful. Don't be a jerk. AI writing patterns are not moral failings — we're building a tool, not a tribunal.

## PR Process

1. Fork and branch from `main`
2. Make your changes
3. Verify pattern counts are consistent
4. Open a PR with a clear description
5. Bonus: include before/after examples that demonstrate your change
