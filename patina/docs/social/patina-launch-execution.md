# patina Launch Execution Packet

Last prepared: 2026-05-23.

Use this packet when the maintainer is ready to post. Agents may prepare copy,
score proof, and follow-up notes, but should not publish from maintainer-owned
accounts.

## Maintainer update template

After each channel action, add a short entry to the maintainer launch note:

```text
Channel:
Status: posted | queued | deferred
URL:
Copy source:
Score command:
Score result:
Notes / feedback:
```

If a post is deferred, record the reason instead of leaving the checkbox
ambiguous.

## Feedback triage

Capture useful launch feedback with enough detail to reproduce it:

- language and register,
- copied paragraph or a private/non-redistributable note,
- score output,
- expected behavior,
- whether the reporter allows the text to be used as a fixture.

Public false-positive reports should use:
<https://github.com/devswha/patina/issues/new?template=false_positive.yml>.

## Close criteria for the launch note

Keep the maintainer launch note open until each channel is either:

- posted with URL and score proof,
- queued with owner/date,
- or explicitly deferred with reason.
